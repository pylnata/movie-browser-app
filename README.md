# Movie-Browser-App

https://api-cinema-10d15.firebaseapp.com


It's a nice app for movie browsing developed by me in order to practice the use of redux-saga and Firebase (Realtime Database). 
Used: 
* create-react-app;
* bootstrap + reactstrap;
* redux-saga;

Application allowes: 
* to filter and search for movie database (using TMDB API);
* to view movie details;
* create User Account to build own watch lists.

P.S. If you want to clone and launch this project, pay attention that src/config.js has to contain your own created API keys.
